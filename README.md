# BarberBookingApplication

In preparation for final year, I have decided to create a simple Booking application in order to help me develop my technical skills.
The application that I will be creating is a booking system app for a barber shop.
This idea was sparked in my head when I was during my year long placement at university. Barber shops typically open from 9am to 5pm. 
During which time I would be working and would be unable to get a haircut. This leadto me waiting in a long queue on a Saturday along with other workers who worked throguhout the week. 
In order to minimize waiting times, I have created this application in order to help a potential barber shop to coordinate their appointments in order to increase customer satisfaction and increase their profits.
